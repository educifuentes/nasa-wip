I want to reformat the layout and appearnece used in this app.
I want to follow the style , layout and code structure of 


Use the same layout following `cols = st.columns([1, 3])`

Then, the cells must contain:

- top_left_cell : year filter selector
- bottom_left_cell : big number chart
- right_cell : Geospatial Map

Use the same style.
